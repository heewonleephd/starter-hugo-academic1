abstract: Collaborative efforts across sectors, scales, and government levels
  have been effective in addressing the goals to reduce petroleum use and
  mitigate environmental issues in the U.S. While community contexts shape local
  collaborative governance, diverse local interests do not necessarily translate
  into collaborations without proper facilitating efforts. This study expands
  the theoretical discussion on the concept of collaborative platforms, which is
  understudied despite their wide use as a governance instrument to catalyze
  local collaboration. Specifically, the way platforms mediate to create local
  collaborations among diverse local-level interests and improve outcomes has
  not been studied much to date. Using data on the Environmental Protection
  Agency's Clean Cities program to promote local collaborative governance
  related to alternative fuels, this paper examines the way collaborative
  platforms create, scale, and affect the outcome of supplying alternative
  fueling infrastructure. The results of multi-level mixed-effects models
  indicate that the collaborative platform integrates local interests to create
  and scale local collaboration, and achieves better outcomes leveraging local
  interests.
